                <h3>Tacos</h3>
                <p> A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla topped
                    with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand</p>

                <h3>Beer</h3>
                <p>Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and the third most
                    popular drink overall after water and tea.</p>

                <h3>Wine</h3>
                <p>Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the
                    grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide and heat. Different varieties of grapes and
                    strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine.</p>

                <h3>Ice Cream</h3>

                    milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such
                    as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches.</p>
